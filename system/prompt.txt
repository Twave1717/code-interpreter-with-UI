Stock Price Data Extraction and Visualization application with GUI:

1. **Define the requirements:**
   - The application should allow the user to enter a company name.
   - The application should fetch stock data for the entered company from a specified URL.
   - The application should display the fetched data in a table.
   - The application should plot the initial price, price in 2002, and price in 2007 for the entered company.
   - The application should display messages in a text box.

2. **Design the UI:**
   - The UI should have a vertical layout.
   - The top of the UI should have a label instructing the user to enter a company name.
   - Below the label, there should be a text input field for the user to enter the company name.
   - Below the text input field, there should be a button that the user can click to start fetching and processing the data.
   - Below the button, there should be a text box to display messages. The text box should be read-only.
   - Below the text box, there should be a table to display the fetched data.
   - Below the table, there should be a plot to display the stock prices.

3. **Fetch and process the data:**
   - Use a separate thread to fetch and process the data to avoid blocking the UI.
   - Use web scraping techniques to extract the stock price data from the web pages Url = 'https://mocki.io/v1/a2491222-4058-40c5-8b1b-3f8f2e3df42a'
   - Fetch the data from the URL using a library like requests.
   - Convert the fetched data into a format that can be displayed in the table and the plot. A library like pandas can be used for this.
   - The JSON response looks like this.
   ```json
    [
    {
        "company": "3M",
        "description": "3M, based in Minnesota",
        "initial_price": 44.28,
        "price_2002": 56.27,
        "price_2007": 95.85,
        "symbol": "MMM"
    },
    {
        "company": "Amazon.com",
        "description": "Amazon.com, Inc. is an online retailer in North America",
        "initial_price": 89.38,
        "price_2002": 17.01,
        "price_2007": 93.43,
        "symbol": "AMZN"
    },
    ....
    ....
    ]
    ```

4. **Update the UI with the fetched data:**
   - When the data is ready, update the table and the plot in the UI.
   - If there's an error while fetching or processing the data, display an error message in the text box.

5. **Handle user interaction:**
   - When the user clicks the button, start the thread to fetch and process the data.
   - When the user enters a company name in the text input field, use this name to fetch the data.

6. **Test the application:**
   - Test the application with different company names to make sure the data is fetched and displayed correctly.
   - Test the application with invalid input to make sure errors are handled correctly.
   - Test the application with slow or no internet connection to make sure it doesn't crash or hang.
